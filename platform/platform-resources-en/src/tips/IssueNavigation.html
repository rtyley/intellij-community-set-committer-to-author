        Did you know that <b>&productName;</b> lets you jump from your checkin comment to an issue in tracker? <br/>
        All you have to do is to define issue navigation patterns in the
        <font  style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight:bold;" size="3" color="#005555">Settings | Version Control</font>

        When you commit a changelist, and type checkin comment, make sure it matches one of your issue navigation patterns.
        Later, when you browse through the changelists in the repository, such comments turn to hyperlinks:
        <p><img hspace="20" src="images/issueNavigation.png"></p>
        Clicking this hyperlink brings you directly to an issue in your task tracker.
