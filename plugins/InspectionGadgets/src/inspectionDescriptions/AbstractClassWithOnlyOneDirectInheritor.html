This inspection is intended for J2ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.

This inspection reports any instances of abstract classes which have precisely one
direct inheritor.   While such classes may offer admirable clarity of design,

the total footprint of the application.  Consider merging the abstract class with it's inheritor.</p>
