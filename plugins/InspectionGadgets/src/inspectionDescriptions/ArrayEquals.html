This inspection reports <b>.equals()</b> being called
to compare two arrays. Calling <b>.equals()</b> on an array
compares identity and is equivalent to using <b>==</b>. Use
<b>==</b> to see if two references reference the same array and
<b>Arrays.equals()</b> to compare the contents of two arrays.
