This inspection reports any attempt to assign a <b><font color="#000080">java.lang.Date</font></b> or
<b><font color="#000080">java.lang.Calendar</font></b> field from a method parameter.
Since <b><font color="#000080">Date</font></b> or <b><font color="#000080">Calendar</font></b> are often
treated as immutable values but are actually mutable, assigning to such a field from a method parameter may
result in an object having its state modified unexpectedly.  While occasionally useful for performance
reasons, this construct is inherently bug-prone.
