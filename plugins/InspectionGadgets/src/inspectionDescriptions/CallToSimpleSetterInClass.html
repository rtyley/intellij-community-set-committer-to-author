This inspection reports any calls to a simple property setter from within the property's class.
A simple property setter is defined as one which simply assigns a the value of its parameter to a field,
and does no other calculation. Such simple setter calls may be safely inlined, at a small performance
improvement. Some coding standards also suggest against the use of simple setters for code clarity
reasons.
