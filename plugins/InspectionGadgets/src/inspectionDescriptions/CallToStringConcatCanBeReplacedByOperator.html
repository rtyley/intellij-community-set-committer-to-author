This inspection reports calls to the <b><font color="#000080">concat</font></b> method
of a <b><font color="#000080">java.lang.String</font></b> object. Such calls can be
replaced with the '+' operator for increased code clarity and possible increased
performance if the method was invoked on a constant with a constant argument.
