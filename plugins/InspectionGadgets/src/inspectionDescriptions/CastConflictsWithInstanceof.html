This inspection reports type cast expressions which are surrounded by an
<b><font color="#000080">instanceof</font></b> check for a different type.
While it is possible that this was intended, such a construct is most likely an error, and will
result in a  <b><font color="#000080">java.lang.ClassCastException</font></b> at runtime.
