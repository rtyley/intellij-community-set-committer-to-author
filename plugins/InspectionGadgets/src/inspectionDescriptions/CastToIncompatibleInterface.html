This inspection reports type cast expressions where
the cast type is an interface, and the cast expression has a class type which neither
implements the cast interface, nor has any visible subclasses which implement or extend the cast interface.
While it is possible that this was intended, such a construct is most likely an error, and will
result in a  <b><font color="#000080">java.lang.ClassCastException</font></b> at runtime.
