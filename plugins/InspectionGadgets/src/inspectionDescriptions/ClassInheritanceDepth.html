This inspection reports any instances of class too deep in the inheritance hierarchy.  Classes too deeply inherited
may be confusing, and are a good sign that refactoring may be necessary. This inspection counts all superclasses
from a library as a single superclass (libraries are considered unmodifyable).
<p>
Use the field provided below to specify the maximum acceptable inheritance depth a class might have.
