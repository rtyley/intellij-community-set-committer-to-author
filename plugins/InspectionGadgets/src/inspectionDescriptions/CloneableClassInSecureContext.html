This inspection reports any instances of classes which may be cloned.  A class
may be cloned if it supports the <b><font color="#000080">Cloneable</font></b> interface,
and its <b><font color="#000080">clone()</font></b> method is not defined to immediately
throw an error.  Cloneable classes may be dangerous in code intended for secure use.
