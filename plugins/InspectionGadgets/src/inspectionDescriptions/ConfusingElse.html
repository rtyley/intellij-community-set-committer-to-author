This inspection reports confusing <b>else</b> branches. Confusing <b>else</b>
branches are branches of <b>if</b> statements whose <b>if</b> branch cannot complete normally and
which are followed by other statements. In these cases, the statements following the
<b>if</b> statement may be moved into the <b>else</b> branch, for increased clarity.
