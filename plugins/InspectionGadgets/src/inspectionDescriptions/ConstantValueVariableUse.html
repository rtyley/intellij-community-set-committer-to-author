This inspection reports any uses of variables which are known to be constant. This
is the case if the (read) use of the variable is surrounded by an
<b><font color="#000080">if</font></b> or <b><font color="#000080">while</font></b>
statement with an == condition which compares the variable with a constant. In such
a case the use
of a variable which is known to be constant can be replaced with the actual constant.
