               This inspection reports any instances of classes which may be deserialized. A class
                may be deserialized if it supports the <b><font color="#000080">Serializable</font></b> interface,
                and its <b><font color="#000080">readObject()</font></b> method is not defined to immediately
                throw an error. Deserializable classes may be dangerous in code intended for secure use.
