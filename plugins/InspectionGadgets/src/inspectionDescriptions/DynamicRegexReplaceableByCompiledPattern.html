This inspection reports calls to the regular expression methods of
<b><font color="#000080">java.lang.String</font></b> using constants arguments.
Such calls may be profitably replaced with a
<b><font color="#000080">private static final Pattern</font></b> field so
that the regular expression does not have to be compiled each time it is used.
