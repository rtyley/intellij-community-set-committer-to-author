This inspection reports any empty classes or Java file without any class defined. A class is empty if it
doesn't have any fields, methods, constructors or initializers. Empty classes are often left over
after large changes or refactorings.
<p>
Use the list below to specify special annotations. Classes annotated with one of
these annotations will be ignored by this inspection.
