<font face="verdana" size="-1">This inspection reports any instances of <b><font color="#000080">synchronized</font></b> statements
having empty bodies.  While theoretically this may be the semantics intended, this construction is
confusing, and often the result of a typo.
<p>
At present, this inspection is disabled in JSP files.
