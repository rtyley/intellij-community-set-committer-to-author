This inspection reports any clases which extend <b><font color="#000080">java.lang.Thread</font></b>.
It is usually thought better practice to delegate to rather than extend
<b><font color="#000080">java.lang.Thread</font></b>, so that a thread creator may exert better
control over the thread's behavior, and to better localize all concurrency related operations.
