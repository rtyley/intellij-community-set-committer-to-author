This inspection reports any classes explicitly declared to extend a utility class. Utility classes
have all fields and methods declared <b><font color="#000080">static</font></b>. Extending a utility
class also allows inadvertent object instantiation of the utility class, because to allow extension
the constructor can not be made private.
