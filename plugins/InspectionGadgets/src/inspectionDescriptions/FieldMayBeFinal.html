This inspection reports any fields which may safely be made <b><font color="#000080">final</font></b>.
A <b><font color="#000080">static</font></b> field may be final if it is initialized in its declaration
or in one static class initializer, but not both. A non-static field may be final if it is initialized
in its declaration or in one non-static class initializer or in all constructors.
