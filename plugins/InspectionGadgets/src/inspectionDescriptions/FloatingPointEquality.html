<font face="verdana" size="-1">This inspection reports any instances of floating-point values
being compared with <b><font color="#000080">==</font></b> or <b><font color="#000080">!=</font></b>.
Floating point values are inherently inaccurate, and comparing them for exact
equality is almost never the desired semantics. This inspection ignores comparisons
with zero literals.
