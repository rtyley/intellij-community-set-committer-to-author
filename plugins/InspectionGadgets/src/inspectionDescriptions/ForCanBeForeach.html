This inspection reports <b>for</b> loops which iterate
over collections or arrays, and can be replaced with the "for each" iteration syntax, available
in Java 5 and newer.
<p>
The setting <b>Report java.util.List indexed loops</b> is responsible for finding loops involving <b>list.get(index)</b> calls.
These loops generally can be replaced with the <b>foreach</b> loops, unless they modify underlying list in the process, e.g. by calling <b>list.remove(index)</b>.
If latter is the case, <b>foreach</b> form of loop may throw <b>ConcurrentModificationException</b>.
<p>
This inspection only reports if the project or module is configured to use a
language level of 5.0 or higher.
