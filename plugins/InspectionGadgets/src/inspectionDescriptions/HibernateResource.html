This inspection reports any Hibernate resource which is not opened in a <b><font color="#000080">try</font></b>
block and closed in the corresponding <b><font color="#000080">finally</font></b> block.  Such resources may
be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed.  Hibernate resources reported
by this inspection include any instances of <b><font color="#000080">org.hibernate.Session</font></b>.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to specify if a Hibernate resource is allowed to be opened inside a try
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a resource
in front of a try block.
