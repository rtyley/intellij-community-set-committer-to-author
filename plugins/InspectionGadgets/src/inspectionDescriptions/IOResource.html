This inspection reports any I/O resource which is not opened in front of a <b><font color="#000080">try</font></b>
block and closed in the corresponding <b><font color="#000080">finally</font></b> block.  Such resources may
be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed.  I/O resources checked
by this inspection include any instances of <b><font color="#000080">java.io.InputStream</font></b>,
 <b><font color="#000080">java.io.OutputStream</font></b>,
 <b><font color="#000080">java.io.Reader</font></b>,
 <b><font color="#000080">java.io.Writer</font></b> and
 <b><font color="#000080">java.io.RandomAccessFile</font></b>.  I/O resources which are wrapped by other I/O resources
are not reported, as the wrapped resource will be closed by the wrapping resource.
<p>
Use the table below to specify which I/O resources should be ignored by this inspection.
Specify I/O resource classes here which do not need to be closed.
Use the checkbox below to specify if a I/O resource is allowed to be opened inside a try
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a resource in front of a try
block.
