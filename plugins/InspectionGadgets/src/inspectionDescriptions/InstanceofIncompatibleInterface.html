This inspection reports <b><font color="#000080">instanceof</font></b> expressions where
the compared type is an interface, and the compared expression has a class type which neither
implements the compared interface, nor has any visible subclasses which implement or extend the compared interface.
While it is possible that this was intended, such a construct is most likely an error, where
the resulting <b><font color="#000080">instanceof</font></b> expression always evaluates to
<b><font color="#000080">false</font></b>
