This inspection reports on uses of <b>instanceof</b> where the type checked for is a concrete class,
rather than an interface. Such uses often indicate excessive coupling to concrete implementations, rather
than abstractions. <b>instanceof</b> expressions whose classes come from system or third-party libraries will not be reported by this inspection.
