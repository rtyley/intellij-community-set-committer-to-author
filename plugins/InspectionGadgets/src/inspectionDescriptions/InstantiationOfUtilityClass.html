This inspection reports any <b><font color="#000080">new</font></b> expressions which instantiate utility classes.
Utility classes have all fields and methods declared <b><font color="#000080">static</font></b>, and their
presence may indicate a lack of object-oriented design.  Instantiation of such classes most likely indicates
programmer error.
