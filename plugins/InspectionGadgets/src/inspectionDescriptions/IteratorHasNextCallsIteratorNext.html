This inspection reports any implementations of <b><font color="#000080">Iterator.hasNext()</font></b>
which call <b><font color="#000080">next()</font></b> on themselves.  While this is a common
mistake, such calls are almost certainly in error, as <b><font color="#000080">hasNext()</font></b>
should not modify the iterators state, while <b><font color="#000080">next()</font></b> should.
