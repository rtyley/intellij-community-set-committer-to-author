This inspection reports any local variables whose type is declared to be a concrete class.
Such declarations may represent a failure of abstraction, and may make testing more difficult.
Declarations whose classes come from system or third-party libraries will not be reported by this inspection.
Catch-block parameters of concrete exception type will also not be reported by this inspection.
