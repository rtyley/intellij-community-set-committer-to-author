This inspection reports instances of collection fields or variables whose contents are either queried and
not updated, or updated and not queried.  Such mismatched queries and updates are pointless, and may indicate
either dead code or a typographical error.
<P>
Use the tables below to specify which methods are update and/or query methods. The names are matched with
the beginning of the method name. Query methods which return their result are automatically detected, only
query methods which return their result in an argument (e.g. write to OutputStream) need to be specified.
