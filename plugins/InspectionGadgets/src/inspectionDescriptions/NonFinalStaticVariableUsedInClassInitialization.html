This inspection reports any uses of non-<b><font color="#000080">final</font></b> <b><font color="#000080">static</font></b> variables during initialization
of a class.  Such uses may make the semantics of the code dependent on order of class
creation, may cause variables to be used before initialized, and generally cause
extremely difficult and confusing bugs.
