This inspection reports any instances of static variables being lazily initialized
in an non-thread-safe manner. Lazy initialization of static variables should be done
in an appropriate synchronization construct, to prevent different threads from
performing conflicting initialization.<br>
  If applicable, quick-fix is suggested
  which introduces static holder pattern described in
  <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_on_demand_holder_idiom">

where the JVM guarantees thread-safety of such initializations.
