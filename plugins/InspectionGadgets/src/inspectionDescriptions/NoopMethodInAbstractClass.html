This inspection reports any instances of "no-op" methods in <b><font color="#000080">abstract</font></b> classes.  It is usually a better
design to make such methods <b><font color="#000080">abstract</font></b> themselves, so that classes which inherit the methods will not forget to provide
their own implementations.
