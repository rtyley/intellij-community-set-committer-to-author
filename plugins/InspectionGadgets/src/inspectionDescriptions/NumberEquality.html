This inspection reports any use of <b><font color="#000080">==</font></b> to test for Number equality,
rather than the <b><font color="#000080">".equals()"</font></b> method. With auto-boxing it is easy
to make the mistake of comparing two Integer (or other subclass of java.lang.Number) objects instead
of two ints.
