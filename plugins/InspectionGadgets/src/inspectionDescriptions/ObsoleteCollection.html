This inspection reports any uses of <b><font color="#000080">java.util.Vector</font></b>
or <b><font color="#000080">java.util.Hashtable</font></b>.  While still supported,
these classes were made obsolete by the JDK1.2 collection classes, and should probably
not be used in new development.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore any cases where the obsolete collections are used
as an argument to a method or assigned to a variable that requires the obsolete type.
Enabling this option is potentially quite processor intensive.
