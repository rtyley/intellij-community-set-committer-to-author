This inspection reports any instances of type casts which are overly strong.  For instance,
casting an object to <b><font color="#000080">ArrayList</font></b> when casting it to
<b><font color="#000080">List</font></b> would do just as well.  <b>Note:</b> much like the <i>Redundant type cast</i>
inspection, applying the fix for this inspection may change the semantics of your program, if you are
intentionally using an overly strong cast to cause a <b><font color="#000080">ClassCastException</font></b> to be generated.  Use caution.
