<font face="verdana" size="-1">This inspection reports any instances of pointless bitwise
expressions.  Such expressions include <b><font color="#000080">and</font></b>ing with zero, <b><font color="#000080">or</font></b>ing by zero,
and shift by zero.  Such expressions may be the result of automated refactorings
not completely followed through to completion, and in any case are unlikely to be what the developer
intended to do.
