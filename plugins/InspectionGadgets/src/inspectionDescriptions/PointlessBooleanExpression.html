<font face="verdana" size="-1">This inspection reports any instances of pointless or pointlessly
complicated boolean expressions.  Such expressions include <b><font color="#000080">and</font></b>ing with true,
<b><font color="#000080">or</font></b>ing with false,
equality comparison with a boolean literal, or negation of a boolean literal.  Such expressions may be the result of automated refactorings
not completely followed through to completion, and in any case are unlikely to be what the developer
intended to do.
