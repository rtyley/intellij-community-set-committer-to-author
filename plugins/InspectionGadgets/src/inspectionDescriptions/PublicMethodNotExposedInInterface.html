This inspection reports <b>public</b> methods in classes
which are not exposed as in interface. Exposing all <b>public</b> methods via interface is important for
maintaining loose coupling, and may be necessary for certain component-based programming styles.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore methods of which the containing class does not
implement a non-library interface.
