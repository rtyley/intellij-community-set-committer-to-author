This inspection reports instances of <b><font color="#000080">public</font></b> methods in classes
which are not exposed as in interface.  Exposing all <b><font color="#000080">public</font></b> methods via interface is important for
maintaining loose coupling, and may be necessary for certain component-based programming styles.
