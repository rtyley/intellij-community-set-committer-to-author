This inspection reports any uses of parameterized classes where the type parameters are omitted.
Such "raw" uses of parameterized types are valid in Java, but defeat the purpose of using
type parameters, and may mask bugs.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore the construction of objects of parameterized types.
<p>
For convenience, this inspection is disabled unless the project uses JDK 5.0.
