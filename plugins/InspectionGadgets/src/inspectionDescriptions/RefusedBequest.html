<font face="verdana" size="-1">This inspection reports any methods which override concrete methods,
but which do not call that method as <b><font color="#000080">super</font></b>.  Such methods
may represent a failure of abstraction, and can lead to hard-to-trace bugs.  Methods overridden
from <b><font color="#000080">java.lang.Object</font></b> are not reported by this inspection.
