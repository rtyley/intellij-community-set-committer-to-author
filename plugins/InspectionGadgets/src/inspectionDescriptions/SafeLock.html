This inspection reports any Lock resource which is not acquired in front of a
<b><font color="#000080">try</font></b> block and unlocked in the corresponding
<b><font color="#000080">finally</font></b> block.  Such resources may
be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed.
