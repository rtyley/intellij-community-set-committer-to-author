This inspection reports any <b><font color="#000080">import</font></b> statements which refer to the same package as the
containing file.  Such imports are unnecessary, and probably the result of incomplete
refactorings.   Since IDEA can automatically  detect and fix such statements with its
"Optimize Imports" command, this inspection is mostly useful for off-line reporting on
code bases that you don't intend to change.
