This inspection reports any instances of classes which may be serialized.  A class
may be serialized if it supports the <b><font color="#000080">Serializable</font></b> interface,
and its <b><font color="#000080">writeObject()</font></b> method is not defined to immediately
throw an error.  Serializable classes may be dangerous in code intended for secure use.
