<font face="verdana" size="-1">This inspection reports any instances of shift operations
where the value shifted by is constant and outside of the reasonable range.  Integer
shift operations outside of the range <b><font color="#000080">0..31</font></b> and long shift operations outside of the
range <b><font color="#000080">0..63</font></b> are reported.  Shifting by negative or overly large values is almost certainly
a coding error.
