This inspection is intended for J2ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.

This inspection reports any calls to <b><font color="#000080">String.startsWith()</font></b> or
<b><font color="#000080">String.endsWith()</font></b> which are passed single character string
literals as parameter. Such calls may be more efficiently implemented with
<b><font color="#000080">String.charAt()</font></b>. Because the performance gain is
minimal, the needed extra check for non-zero length, and the negative effect on
code clarity, it is recommended to do so only inside tight loops.
