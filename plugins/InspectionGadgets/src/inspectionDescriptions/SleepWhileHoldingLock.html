This inspection reports instances of calls to <b><font color="#000080">java.lang.Thread.sleep()</font></b> that occur while
within a <b><font color="#000080">synchronized</font></b> block or method.  Sleeping
while synchronized may result in decreased performance, poor scalability, and possibly
even deadlocking.  Consider using <b><font color="#000080">wait</font></b> instead,
as it will release the lock held.
