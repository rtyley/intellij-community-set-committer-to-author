This inspection reports any Socket resource which is not opened in front of a <b><font color="#000080">try</font></b>
block and closed in the corresponding <b><font color="#000080">finally</font></b> block.  Such resources may
be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed.  Socket resources reported
by this inspection include any instances of <b><font color="#000080">java.net.Socket</font></b>,
     <b><font color="#000080">java.net.DatagramSocket</font></b>,
and <b><font color="#000080">java.net.ServerSocket</font></b>.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to specify if a Socket is allowed to be opened inside a try
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a Socket
in front of a try block.
