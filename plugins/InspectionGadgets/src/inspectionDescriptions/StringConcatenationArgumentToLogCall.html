This inspection reports non-constant string concatenations used as an argument to a SLF4J log method.
Concatenation will be evaluated even when the logging message will not be logged; this can negatively impact performance.
It is recommended to use parameterization instead which will only be evaluated when the string is actually logged and not when logging is disabled.
