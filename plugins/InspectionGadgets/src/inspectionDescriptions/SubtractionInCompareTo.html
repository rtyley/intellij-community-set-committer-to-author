<font face="verdana" size="-1">This inspection reports any instances of subtraction in
<b><font color="#000080">compareTo()</font></b> methods.  While it is a common idiom to
use the results of integer subtraction as the return of a <b><font color="#000080">compareTo()</font></b>
method, this construct may cause subtle and difficult bugs in cases of integer overflow.
Comparing the integer values directly and returning -1, 0, or 1 is better practice in almost
all cases.
