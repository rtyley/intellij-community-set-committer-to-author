<font face="verdana" size="-1">This inspection reports any instances of <b><font color="#000080">switch</font></b> statements
with too low a ratio of switch labels to executable statements.  Such <b><font color="#000080">switch</font></b> statements
may be confusing, and should probably be refactored.
