This inspection reports any calls to <b><font color="#000080">Thread.stop()</font></b>,
<b><font color="#000080">Thread.suspend()</font></b>, or <b><font color="#000080">Thread.resume()</font></b>.
These calls are inherently prone to data corruption and deadlock, and their use is strongly
discouraged.
