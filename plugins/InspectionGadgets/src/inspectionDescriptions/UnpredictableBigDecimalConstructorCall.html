This inspection reports on calls to <b><font color="#000080">BigDecimal</font></b>
constructors which accept a <b><font color="#000080">double</font></b> value.
These constructors can have somewhat unpredictable results because many numbers
cannot be represented exactly in a <b><font color="#000080">double</font></b>.
It is recommend to use the constructors which accept a String instead.
