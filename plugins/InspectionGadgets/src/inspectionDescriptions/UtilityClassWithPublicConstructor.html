This inspection reports any instances of utility classes with <b><font color="#000080">public</font></b>  constructors.  Utility
classes have all fields and methods declared <b><font color="#000080">static</font></b>. Giving such classes a <b><font color="#000080">public</font></b>
constructor is confusing, and may lead to the class being inadvertently instantiated.
