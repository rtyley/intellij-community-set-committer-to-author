This inspection reports any instances of utility classes which do not have <b><font color="#000080">private</font></b> constructors.
Utility classes have all fields and methods declared <b><font color="#000080">static</font></b> .  Giving such classes a <b><font color="#000080">private</font></b>
constructor prevents them from being inadvertently instantiated.
