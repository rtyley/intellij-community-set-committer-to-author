This inspection reports on any call to <b><font color="#000080">wait()</font></b>
made on a <b><font color="#000080">java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition</font></b>
object.   This is probably a programming error, and some variant of the
<b><font color="#000080">await()</font></b> method was intended instead.
