/**
 * IntelliJ code provides a lot of statical bindings to the interested pieces of data. For example we need to execute code
 * like below to get list of modules for the target project:
 * <pre>
 *   ModuleManager.getInstance(project).getModules()
 * </pre>
 * That means that it's not possible to test target classes in isolation if corresponding infrastructure is not set up.
 * However, we don't want to set it up if we execute a simple standalone test.
 * <p/>
 * This interface is intended to encapsulate access to the underlying IntelliJ functionality.
 * <p/>
 * Implementations of this interface are expected to be thread-safe.
