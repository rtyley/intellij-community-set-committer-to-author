<p>We need you for 5 seconds. This will be the only time you see this screen, we promise!

<p>It's been ### days since you started evaluating, and your opinion is really valuable to us.
<ul>
  <li>If you have any technical questions that you would like to ask</li>
  <li>If you would like to tell us about the things you love/hate about </li>
  <li>If you have questions about licensing or purchasing</li>
</ul>
Just click the <strong>Submit Feedback</strong> button, and we'll get back to you super fast.<br>
You can use the <strong>Help | Submit Feedback</strong> menu item at any time later.

<p>Thanks! We look forward to helping you out in any way we can.
